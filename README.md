# Adventure_game.py

This is a simple text-based adventure game built with Python, where the player explores a house, cave, and field while preparing to face a randomly chosen enemy. The game involves choosing paths, selecting weapons, and engaging in a randomized battle system. Player choices impact the score, and the game ends when the player either wins by reaching 200 points or loses by dropping to 0. It includes multiple functions for location navigation, weapon selection, and replayability through a restart option.
